# poc-backend
Hello this is a cargo management system
For front-end i wrote several pages: login page, search page, detail page, etc.Utilzed Axios to send and handle http request. Utilzed redux to let components conmunicate with each other and used redux-thunk to solve the async problem.
For back-end Utlized spring boot to handle CRUD requests to comunicate with database. And utlized JWT for security part.
